                        <p> <b>About:</b> "Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's
                            Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful
                            character, known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player
                            versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base."</p>
                        <p> <b>My experince:</b> I play it because I enjoy a challange. A basic game lasts for at least 20 minutes and one has to play in a team of 5, I usually ply international games with different people that I keep meeting. It encourages
                            good communication and teamwork for a win. Heroes one should ban before they play with me: Viper, Jakiro, Ancient Apparition, Enchantress, Death Prophrt.</p>

                            <p><b>About:</b> "The original trilogy focuses on the conflict between humanity and the subterranean reptilian hominids known as the Locust Horde on the world of Sera. The first installment, titled Gears of War, was released on
                                November 7, 2006 for the Xbox 360. The game follows protagonist Marcus Fenix, a soldier in the Coalition of Ordered Governments tasked to lead a last-ditch effort to destroy the Locust Horde and save humanity. Two subsequent
                                titles, Gears of War 2 (2008) and Gears of War 3 (2011), featured a three-way conflict between humanity, the Locust Horde and their mutated counterparts, the Lambent. Gears of War: Judgment, a spin-off prequel to the series'
                                first title, was released in 2013; it focuses on Damon Baird, one of Fenix's squad-mates.[1] Gears of War: Ultimate Edition was released for the Xbox One and Microsoft Windows between August 2015 to March 2016.[2] The fourth
                                installment in the series, Gears of War 4, is set 25 years after Gears of War 3 and follows Marcus Fenix's son, JD and his friends as they battle security forces deployed by a totalitarian COG government as well as the
                                Swarm, a reconstituted version of the Locust Horde that once again threatens humanity.[3] Gears 5 (2019) is the direct sequel to Gears of War 4 and revolves around Kait Diaz, a friend of JD, who embarks on a quest to learn
                                the truth about her past and the connections between her heritage and the Locust Horde."</p>
                            <p><b>My experince:</b> I grew up on this game and have played all of them. My favorites have to be Gears of War and Gears Of War 3. The storyline is amazing and I enjoy the weapons in the game, have to choose wisely as you sometimes
                                have to keep going with the same one for a long while.Avoid me if I have the Longshot or Gnasher.</p>

                                that the game gives you an option to come in guns blazing or stealth</p>

                                boards. The game is set nineteen years after the events of Tekken 2, in which Heihachi Mishima defeated his own son Kazuya in the second "King of Iron Fist" martial arts tournament in order to reclaim his position as head
                                of the powerful Mishima Zaibatsu."
